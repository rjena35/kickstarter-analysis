# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To analyze and visualize data on kickstarter campaigns from 2014 to 2016 to help Louise identify trends and plan for future campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date!
  I created a pivot table to filter by parent category and years. With the types of outcomes as my columns and months as the rows, I counted the number of different outcomes based on theater parent category.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  I compared the percentage of failed campaigns to succesful campaigns bad on the monetary goals of the campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	One of my biggest challenges was manipulating the pivot table fields to display the information correctly. 
    Getting the months to appear properly in my rows field was also a small challenge but I overcame it.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	  The month of May had the highest number of succesful theater outcomes and peaked with 111.
  	After this peak, the number of succesful campaigns decreased in conjunction with the total number of campaigns
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	  Of the campaigns with the sub category "plays", none were canceled.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    The data only shows the results of analyzing 3 years. The data and trends could look differently if more data from otehr years were also included.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	  For Outcomes Based on Goals, individual pie charts for each month can be made to visualize the percentage of succesful and failed campaigns
